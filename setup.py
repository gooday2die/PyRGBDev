Short message of setup.py from Gooday2die
I was so much pissed off due to this script working wierd.
Everytime I try to open the project and then add more SDKs or make up more features, the project DOES NOT load.
Then I try to make this code load again and again. The basic process of each day while I am making this library is:

1. Open up Pycharm
2. Do a bit of testing with previous code from last night
3. Does NOT work.
4. Fix setup.py and environments and do things in order to fix the same setup issues with different reason every day.
5. And I am sick of going from 1~4 everyday just to make things fixed into a state that was working before.

Bunch of known issues with setup.py
1. data_files of setup() does NOT get proper directory of where the DLLs should be located.
   Everytime when I try to get the directory of pyrgbdev library, it does not retrieve the correct directory.
   Thus, this should be avoided and ran as a separate commands.
2. ERROR: Could not install packages due to an OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:
   This is due to Windows maximum length of directory. Check
   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52949531/could-not-install-packages-due-to-an-environmenterror-errno-13
   for more information. Bottom line is that to solve this, install package with pip install . --user.
